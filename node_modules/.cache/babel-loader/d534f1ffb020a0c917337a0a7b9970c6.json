retirement planning is understood by all. However, very often people retire without achieving their ideal retirement fund sum. The reasons vary from spending habits, unforeseen expenses or lack of knowledge of investment. Here are some challenges faced by most people who want to plan for a comfortable retirement.\r\n            </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </section>\r\n            <section class=\"retirement-plan\">\r\n                <div class=\"container\">\r\n                    <div class=\"commn-outr wow fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <p>Today we are going do discuss the 4 major factors, which challenge and distract individuals from saving for retirement</p>\r\n                        <div class=\"row\">\r\n                            <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-6\">\r\n                                <div class=\"retirement-factor  wow fadeInUp\">\r\n                                    <img src={require(\"../images/retirement-01.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\r\n                                    <div class=\"retirement-txt\">\r\n                                        <span class=\"suga\">Factor No. 1</span>\r\n                                        <h4>Inefficient budgeting</h4>\r\n                                        <p>\r\n\r\n                                            The ever increasing expenses are not always met with proportional income increments. Over the past decade average inflation rate has been XX whereas the average increment is only XX. And every increase in income bring increase in expenses such as better house, better cars and a better lifestyle in general. This inefficient budgeting of income causes people to feel that they do not enough money to earmark for retirement.\r\n                                           \r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-6\">\r\n                                <div class=\"retirement-factor  wow fadeInUp\">\r\n                                    <img src={require(\"../images/retirement-02.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\r\n                                    <div class=\"retirement-txt\">\r\n                                        <span class=\"suga\">Factor No 2</span>\r\n                                        <h4>Late planning</h4>\r\n                                        <p>\r\n\r\n                                            People are not likely to think about retirement funds when they are in their hay days. This is a common mistake made by many young hard working individuals who believe that retirement is too far to worry about. It is much later that the importance of retirement fund dawns to them. This risk can be voided by timely planning how you use your hard earned money.\r\n                                           \r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"col-sm-6 col-md-6\">\r\n                                <div class=\"retirement-factor  wow fadeInUp\">\r\n                                    <img src={require(\"../images/retirement-03.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\r\n                                    <div class=\"retirement-txt\">\r\n                                        <span class=\"suga\">Factor No. 3</span>\r\n                                        <h4>Non-priority</h4>\r\n                                        <p>\r\n\r\n                                            A man earns to meet many ends such as new house, holidays or a wedding.
