Our recommended portfolio will be different for someone who is risk averse, has a large portfolio and is nearing retirement, as opposed to someone who is 30 years old, has a smaller portfolio and is willing to face some volatility for higher returns. Many studies have shown that the \"right\" asset allocation is the most critical variable in creating sustained wealth over the long term, but is often the most overlooked aspect. The asset allocation evolves as the portfolio matures and investor requirements change. We help you create and maintain the right balance of assets, over the life of your portfolio.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                                <li>\r\n                                    The \"right\" funds - There are no \"best funds\" in our view-only \"right funds\". So we recommend the funds which suit your profile best. For instance, a fund might be the \"best performing fund\" in its category, but that simply means that its returns are the best over one time period-it doesn�t take into account that it has been very volatile in giving those returns. For a conservative investor who prefers stable and stress-free investments, such fund may not be the right pics. On the other hand the same fund may be right for aggressive investors looking for high returns.\r\n                    </li>\r\n                            </ul>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                Welathclock's algorithms will ensure that you invest in the right mix of funds and the right funds.
