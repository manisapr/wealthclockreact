Over the past decade average inflation rate has been XX whereas the average increment is only XX. And every increase in income bring increase in expenses such as better house, better cars and a better lifestyle in general. This inefficient budgeting of income causes people to feel that they do not enough money to earmark for retirement.\r\n\r\n                                    </p>\r\n\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div className=\"col-sm-6 col-md-6\">\r\n                                <div className=\"retirement-factor  wow fadeInUp\">\r\n                                    <img src={require(\"../images/retirement-02.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\r\n                                    <div className=\"retirement-txt\">\r\n                                        <span className=\"suga\">Factor No 2</span>\r\n                                        <h4>Late planning</h4>\r\n                                        <p>\r\n\r\n                                            People are not likely to think about retirement funds when they are in their hay days.
