                                We use two pillars to ensure that you create wealth in the manner best suited to you. These two pillars are:
                </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The "right" asset allocation -By this we mean your investment has the right mix of funds , I,e, equity and debt, that are best suited to your risk appetite and goals. Our recommended portfolio will be different for someone who is risk averse, has a large portfolio and is nearing retirement, as opposed to someone who is 30 years old, has a smaller portfolio and is willing to face some volatility for higher returns. Many studies have shown that the "right" asset allocation is the most critical variable in creating sustained wealth over the long term, but is often the most overlooked aspect. The asset allocation evolves as the portfolio matures and investor requirements change. We help you create and maintain the right balance of assets, over the life of your portfolio.
                    </li>
                                <li>
                                    The "right" funds - There are no "best funds" in our view-only "right funds". So we recommend the funds which suit your profile best. For instance, a fund might be the "best performing fund" in its category, but that simply means that its returns are the best over one time period-it doesn’t take into account that it has been very volatile in giving those returns. For a conservative investor who prefers stable and stress-free investments, such fund may not be the right pics. On the other hand the same fund may be right for aggressive investors looking for high returns.
                    </li>
                            </ul>

                                Welathclock's algorithms will ensure that you invest in the right mix of funds and the right funds. The ideal mix will keep changing as per your requirements and maturity of portfolio.

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The first is expectations: if you want to live like a king you need to come up with a plan to accumulate enough funds to do so.&nbsp;
                                    The accumulation to live like a pauper is much lower.&nbsp; So expectations are very important.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                                <li>
                                    The second is accumulating.&nbsp; You need to accumulate commensurately with your expectations.&nbsp;
                                    A person desiring to live like a king needs to accumulate great wealth, a person satisfied to live like a pauper requires much less.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                                <li>
                                    The third is spending.&nbsp; Each time you spend you need to keep the expectation in line.&nbsp;
                                    Spending now may make it harder to live like a king later while spending now may make it easier to live like a pauper.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                All three require decisions to be made constantly, whether these decisions are made consciously or unconsciously are up to you.

                            When are you most likely to do a reality check on your investments? Is it when they're doing well? Or is it when the
                            markets are down and you're nervous? Chances are it is the latter, which may not be the optimal time to make investment
                            decisions, particularly if emotions are high. That's why taking the time to do an annual review of your investments and
                            other financial matters makes sense. "Think of it as if you were driving on a dangerous road. That's not when you check
                            your brakes and tires. You do that before, so you know they are in good shape."
            </p>
                        <p>
                            An annual financial checkup can accomplish many things. You can stop and think about your family's financial goals,
                            such as saving for retirement, a house, or a child's education. You can consider reducing taxes on your investments,
                            protecting your income, or building a financial cushion. Once you are clear on your goals, you can then work on ensuring
                            that you are investing appropriately for those goals.
